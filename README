'modules' version 0.01
======================

Example:

	use modules qw(strict warnings 5.006 Data::Dumper);

becomes the short version for:

	use 5.006;
	use strict;
	use warnings;
	use Data::Dumper;

ABSTRACT

If you are bored by multiple 'use'-statement and asked why you cannot load
several modules/pragma's with one single 'use'-line: Then you will find
'modules' handy, because thats what it does.

Ironically 'modules' is a module. The name was choosen (against the recommendation
to use lower case names for pragma's only), because the 'use modules' construct
sounds so self-explanatory.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following (on Win32 use ie. 'nmake'):

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

DEPENDENCIES

The 'CPAN' module if the 'force' feature is turned on.

FEATURES

	- automatically loads modules from CPAN (via the CPAN module) if they fail
	loading. So just 'use modules qw(Exotic::Module)' in your script and do not care if
	its on the local system or not, because if not 'modules' catches and installs
	it from CPAN.
