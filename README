'modules' version 0.01
======================

Example:

	use modules qw(strict warnings 5.006 Data::Dumper);

becomes the short version for:

	use 5.006;
	use strict;
	use warnings;
	use Data::Dumper;

ABSTRACT

If you are bored by multiple 'use'-statement and asked why you cannot load
several modules/pragma's with one single 'use'-line: Then you will find
'modules' handy, because thats what it does.

Ironically 'modules' is a module. The name was choosen (against the recommendation
to use lower case names for pragma's only), because the 'use modules' construct
sounds so self-explanatory.

I just recommend to use it, if you know for what its good for. If you are a perl-
beginner, it may more confuse you instead of helping to shrink your code for some
characters again.
